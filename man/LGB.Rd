This function uses the LGB Method to detect significant effects in unreplicated fractional factorials.
}
\usage{
LGB(Beta, alpha = 0.05, rpt = TRUE, plt = TRUE, pltl = TRUE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{Beta}{
input - this is the numeric vector of effects or coefficients to be tested
}
  \item{alpha}{
input - This is the significance level of the test
}
  \item{rpt}{
input - this is a logical variable that controls whether the report is written (default is TRUE)
}
  \item{plt}{
input - this is a logical variable that controls whether a half-normal plot is made (default is TRUE)
}
  \item{pltl}{
input - this is a logical variable that controls whether the significance limit line is drawn on the half-normal plot (default is TRUE)
}
